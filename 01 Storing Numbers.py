#Data Types

#Data types indicate what information you are using...
#Numbers, text, true/false


#Variables are temporary holders of that information
#Here we define some variables and let the software know what data they will hold  
#We can then assign some data to those variables
#Variables can be added, subtracted, multiplied, divided etc.

#Basic Variable
a=1
a=a+1

print a

#Adding 2 Variables
num1=5
num2=10

sum=num1+num2

print sum

#You can also output the values of the variables above using a string 
print "The Sum of:", sum

#Add complexity to the string
print "The Sum of:",num1, "and", num2, "is", sum
