#String Data Type

#Strings are pieces of texts represented in quotation marks
#Python allows for either single or double quotes
#The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator

sometext = "This is a piece of text"

print sometext

#Add and concatenate strings together
#This will add the following text to the string of text printed above

moretext = sometext + ". This is some more text"

print moretext
