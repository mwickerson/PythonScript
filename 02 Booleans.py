#Boolean Data Type

#Evaluates whether a statement is true or false
#If you have a condition, that question results in a boolean true or false value
#These values can be used as a conditional logic so that you can 
#do something if it is true or if it is false

mycheck = True
mycheck = False

#Check if 5 is less than 2 
#Results in a false value

mycheck = 5 < 2
print mycheck

#Check if 2 is less than 5 
#Results in a true value

mycheck = 5 > 2
print mycheck
